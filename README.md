### 1. Context
As both of the app's creators are environmental enthusiasts who are concerned about the destination of all the waste produced and the reality of recycling, we've decided to come up with an alternative to companies that want to make a difference and want to make sure that their waste is properly reinserted in the production chain.

#### i. Recycling in Brazil
The brazilian reality related to recycling is quite worrisome. Brazil ranks fourth in the global waste producer ranking, with 11.3 billion tons. While 91% of the waste are collected, only 1.28% are actually reinserted in the production chain. According to the Waste Atlas, the brazilian recycling rate is around 1%.

As a further improvement we would like to expand our business to also attend individuals who don't know what to do with all the recycling materials they produce and want it to be reinserted in the production chain. For that, we would provide a way to connect to waste-pickers who would handle the logistics.
